# Explicit Self Implementation - Follow-up Needed

## Current Status
1. PR #13 has been merged, but not all explicit self references were properly fixed
2. We're seeing compilation errors due to remaining issues in several files:
   - TunaSettings.swift
   - KeyboardShortcutManager.swift
   - AudioModeManager.swift
   - DictationManager.swift
   - TabRouter.swift

## Next Steps
1. Created a new branch 'fix-remaining-explicit-self-issues'
2. Run SwiftFormat with more specific options
3. Manually fix any remaining issues
4. Create and merge a follow-up PR

## Root Cause
The issue appears to be that SwiftFormat did not add explicit self in string interpolation and closure contexts consistently. We'll need to specifically target these cases in the follow-up PR.
